# Conversational RAG With PDF Uploads üß†üìÑ

This project enables users to upload PDFs and interact with their content using a **Conversational Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system, powered by **LangChain**, **Streamlit**, and **Groq's Gemma2-9b-It** model.

## Features

- Upload and process multiple PDF documents
- Conversational memory with contextual chat history
- Reformulates user queries using past conversation for improved retrieval
- Embedding-based document search using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- Answer generation via Gemma2-9b-It LLM
- Seamless integration of HuggingFace, LangChain, and ChromaDB
